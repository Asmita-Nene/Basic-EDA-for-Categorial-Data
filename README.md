## Project Overview
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a Netflix dataset containing information about movies and TV shows. The dataset primarily consists of **categorical data** with attributes like title, type, director, cast, country, rating, and release information.

The main goal is to uncover interesting patterns and insights by cleaning the data and visualizing key trends.
